# Design

## Intent

Establish the high-level architectural blueprint for a Project. Design documents focus on the "how" at a system or multi-component level, ensuring that individual work items will fit together into a cohesive whole.

Design is broader than Planning. While a Plan (`plan.md`) details changes for a specific work item, a Design (`design.md`) details the architecture, data models, and interface contracts for a Project.

## When to Design

- A Project has been initiated and its purpose is understood
- High-level architectural decisions need to be made before work items can be defined
- Changes affect multiple repositories or services
- New patterns or standards are being introduced to the codebase

## Document Storage & Naming

The design document (a prose artifact) lives within the project folder in all modes:

- `docs/projects/<slug>/design.md`

## Required Content

Every `design.md` must include:

- **Context** — a brief reminder of the Project's purpose.
- **Architectural Overview** — a high-level description of the solution. Diagrams (Mermaid) are encouraged.
- **Key Components** — description of the primary modules, services, or layers involved.
- **Data Models / Schemas** — definitions of significant data structures or database changes.
- **Interfaces / APIs** — contract definitions for communication between components.
- **Non-Functional Requirements** — performance, security, scalability, or observability constraints.
- **Alternatives Considered** — why this design was chosen over other options.

## Procedure

1. **Draft** — create the `design.md` and document the proposed architecture.
2. **Review** — follow the `DesignReview.md` procedure to ensure the design meets the project goals and technical standards.
3. **Iterate** — update the design based on review feedback.
4. **Approve** — once approved, the design serves as the foundation for decomposing the project into Work Items.

## Guidance

- Focus on the "High-Level Invariants" that must be true across all work items.
- Avoid over-specifying details that belong in a work item's `plan.md`.
- Use the Design phase to resolve cross-cutting concerns (e.g., "How will we handle authentication across these three repos?").
- The Design document is a living document during the Design phase, but should become relatively stable once the project moves to Execution.
