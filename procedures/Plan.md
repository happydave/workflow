# Plan

## Purpose

Structured approach for deep human-AI collaboration on software projects. Human remains deeply involved throughout planning.

This document describes how to create feature plans for an AI agent, not a finished product other than those plans.

## Intent

Produce feature plans with enough clear, precise, descriptive detail that an AI can implement the feature correctly on the first attempt with minimal guesswork and maximum freedom for optimal implementation choices.

## Plan Structure

Every plan must include the sections below. Complete only what is genuinely necessary for unambiguous implementation; omit or mark optional sections that do not apply.

**Objective**
One clear sentence that captures the single desired purpose of the feature.
Example: Enable users to securely register, verify their email, and log in so they can access protected resources.

**Invariants & Hard Constraints**
Bullet list of non-negotiable truths that must always hold. Keep this list short and provable. Include only items that, if violated, break correctness, security, or compliance.

Each invariant must be traceable to an explicit statement or direct implication in the work item. Before adding an invariant, identify which sentence or requirement it derives from. Invariants with no traceable origin must not be added.

Good examples:
- Passwords are never stored in plain text or reversible form.
- All authentication tokens expire and cannot be used after revocation.
- Personally identifiable data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or stronger.

Bad example (do not add invariants like this):
- Must handle concurrent requests. *(Untraceable — the work item says nothing about concurrency; this is an invented constraint.)*

(For project-wide security rules — e.g., OWASP Top 10 mitigation, no plain-text secrets in logs — reference a central security.md or include critical ones here.)

**Required Behaviors & Verifications**
Concise descriptions of required behavior and verifiable success criteria. Organize by major concern (user-visible actions, data flows, security/privacy, etc.). Where the concerns are the files the change touches, every requirement goes under a file it changes, one about several files under one of them: a trailing section of requirements outside the per-file sections reads as commentary, and is skipped (WI 1225). Use SHALL statements for must-have outcomes and include focused scenarios (Gherkin-style or numbered steps) that define "done." Cover at least: one happy path, one key failure mode, one security-relevant case.

Tag each scenario by **verification mode** — the axis is *who can supply the verdict*:
- `[automated]` — a deterministic gate decides it: a test, a build, a lint, a schema check. Repeatable, pass/fail, no judgment.
- `[agent]` — no deterministic gate exists, but the agent can gather and judge the evidence itself by **inspecting the artifact**: reading a generated image or video frames, reading rendered output, diffing files, examining a produced document. Requires judgment, but the agent can supply it.
- `[human]` — requires the **owner**: aesthetic taste, a product or design call, physical hardware, hearing audio, playing the game, or a decision that is theirs to make. The agent cannot substitute for it.

The Code and Complete actions use these tags to know which outcomes the agent can close itself and which need the owner. **`[agent]` checks are the agent's responsibility to perform and close** — an unmet `[agent]` criterion is unfinished work, not a sign-off waiting on the owner, and must not be deferred as if it were. A work item whose only unmet criteria are `[human]` is implementation-complete pending that confirmation, not ambiguously unfinished.

Choosing `[human]` when `[agent]` would do is a real failure mode: it defers to the owner a check the agent could have run, and it lets a result that *looks* right on automated metrics pass without anyone inspecting the artifact. If you can look at the thing, tag it `[agent]` and look.

**A verification must be able to fail.** Choose inputs that an implementation without the behavior, without any one clause of it, or looser than it would answer differently, and say what that implementation would give. Work one example through the rule with the constants the code holds, and check it passes on a correct implementation. Replace a value that gives the same outcome either way: a multiplier of 1, an armour of 0, a value equal to a default or a fallback, one that rounds to the same result, a name already in the case the code folds to; an assertion loose enough to accept both results — a wide range, "plausible", "about" — fails the same way. Where a behavior names several shapes or actors, name a test for each. This chooses values for the cases the plan already names and adds a case only for a clause no case reaches. A verification that cannot fail surfaces at Code's break pass (`Code.md` step 4). Source: WIs 1756, 1757, 1824, 1827.

Feature shapes that have repeatedly hidden a defect until implementation; when the feature includes one, the plan pins the detail:

- **An authentication default** — one scenario per credential kind accepted, not only the default path.
- **A server-initiated message triggered by a client request** (a retained message on subscribe, a replay on connect) — its order relative to the acknowledgement of the request.
- **A replicated-state change** — which node acts on apply, which on the proposer's result, and how those may interleave.
- **A shared identifier** (a key, a code, a name format used by more than one component) — its exact form and the package that owns it.
- **A gate command with a test-binary flag** — the exact package path, never a `./...` pattern.
- **A critical section split across two locks** — what another caller can observe between them, what a crash between them leaves behind, and whether the whole's acknowledgement may precede the part under the second lock.
- **A destructive, irreversible, or outward-facing operation** — the decision that governs it, a pure predicate the operation calls that computes everything it decides on (`AGENTS.md`).
- **A rule that follows references through content data** (chains, conditions, links between records) — how each recursion is bounded, verified with data that loops.
- **The removal or rename of a package, file, or exported name** — every importer and caller, found by search, among the files the plan changes.
- **A long-running command run under a service manager** — its headless output rate and stream, measured for a minute before choosing where the output goes.

**Migration note.** The prior two-way scheme used `[visual/manual]` for everything non-automated. An existing `[visual/manual]` tag should be read as `[human]` by default (the conservative reading); re-triage it to `[agent]` opportunistically when the check is in fact one the agent can perform by inspection.
Example:
- SHALL allow new users to register with a valid email and strong password, then send a time-limited verification link.
- SHALL reject registration attempts with duplicate emails (return 409 Conflict).
Given valid email and strong password
When user submits registration
Then verification email is sent and account is created in unverified state
AI has freedom over: route patterns, validation libraries, exact HTTP status wording (unless security-critical), internal error handling structure, and non-functional optimizations unless listed below.

**Edge Cases & Required Error Responses**
Bullet list of significant exceptions and exactly how the system must respond (status code, user message intent, retryability, etc.).

**Non-Functional Constraints** (only when critical to the project)
List only project-wide or feature-specific requirements that affect correctness or viability.

**Data & State Changes** (when the feature affects persistent state)
Simple description of new/updated entities and allowed transitions — no schema syntax or implementation detail.

**Explicit AI Freedom**
Mandatory closing section that lists what is intentionally **not** constrained. Tailor this list to reflect the actual project tech stack (e.g., specify allowed frameworks).
Example:
The AI has full discretion over:
- Choice of libraries and patterns within the approved tech stack
- File and directory organization
- Naming conventions (except where names are user-visible or constrained)
- Internal code structure and optimizations
- Exact phrasing of non-security-critical user messages

**Applicable Guidelines**
Identify which `skills/` documents apply to this project and record them in the plan. For each applicable guideline, note:
- What that guideline defines as the **build** step(s) — any procedure that compiles, formats, lints, or otherwise transforms source artifacts into verified output.
- What that guideline defines as the **test** step(s) — any procedure that validates correctness against specified behavior.

Reference these guidelines in the plan's **Required Behaviors & Verifications** section wherever build or test context is relevant. This information drives the Code and Document actions: implementers look here first rather than inferring guidelines from project structure.

Examples of applicable guidelines: `skills/go.md`, `skills/typescript.md`, `skills/docker.md`, `skills/markdown.md`, `skills/tooling.md`.

If no guidelines apply (e.g., a pure prose or workflow document), state that explicitly.

**Dependencies & Context**
Reference related documents or prior features only when order or shared invariants matter.

**Remaining Unknowns & Research Items**
Bullet list of items that require further research, testing, or human clarification. If an unknown is resolved, move the resulting requirements to the appropriate section; otherwise, keep it here to signal risk to the implementer.

## Style Guide

- Plaintext Markdown only
- Concise, objective, precise language
- No code (structs, functions, declarations) appears in any planning document
- Headings for structure (# Phase, ## Step)
- Bullets for lists; numbered for sequences
- Strong descriptive text of expected behavior, data flows, edge cases, invariants — enough to eliminate ambiguity for implementation
- Invariant section: each invariant provably true given fundamental constraints, with no unstated assumptions or dependencies and no implicit contradictions; traceability to the work item is governed by **Invariants & Hard Constraints** above
- This framework assumes invariants will be scrutinized during the Critically Assess step
- Heading hierarchy wording: avoid directional terms like "higher level" or "lower level" when describing markdown heading structure — these are ambiguous because H1 is simultaneously highest in document hierarchy and lowest in heading number. Use level-number comparisons instead: "a heading whose level number is ≤ N" or "a heading at depth ≤ the matched heading."

## Document Storage & Naming

Feature plans (prose artifacts) live inside the work item folder. When a work item is promoted to a plan, create `plan.md` in the folder:

- `docs/pending/<id>-<name>/plan.md`

The presence of `plan.md` in a work item folder indicates the item has been planned. The absence of `plan.md` indicates it has not.

## General Guidelines

### Language-Specific Guidelines

The planning process MUST identify all applicable guidelines and document them in the feature plan's **Applicable Guidelines** section. This is mandatory, not optional. Guidelines from `skills/[name].md` define the build and test procedures that Code and Document actions will use — they cannot be applied correctly if they are not named in the plan.

- Inspect the project root and purpose to determine which guidelines apply (e.g., `skills/go.md` for Go projects, `skills/typescript.md` (plus the applicable profile) for TypeScript projects, `skills/docker.md` for Docker-based builds, `skills/markdown.md` whenever the change writes or edits a Markdown file, such as a README, whatever the project's language). A work item that creates a repository includes a README among its changes.
- `skills/tooling.md` applies whenever the work depends on an external tool (a CLI, MCP server, or editor extension), independently of language. Tool-specific reference material lives in `knowledge/tools/`.
- `skills/measurement.md` applies whenever the work item includes a measurement (a benchmark, a scale run, a resource envelope) or builds a harness that checks properties over runs.
- Record each applicable guideline and its defined build/test steps in the plan's Applicable Guidelines section.
- If a project spans multiple guidelines (e.g., Go + Docker), list all of them.

### Knowledge Management

- **File-First Documentation**: Aggressively add information to the plan doc as it is discovered. 
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not restate context or technical details in chat that are (or should be) in the `plan.md`. Use the plan as the primary storage for all technical findings.
- **State Management**: Use chat for coordination and intent; use the plan for specification. If you find yourself explaining "how" something works in chat, move that explanation to the plan instead.
- **Explicit Gaps**: Always maintain a "Remaining Unknowns" section to track items that require further research or human clarification before or during implementation.

### Cross-Feature Relationships

- Cross-feature dependencies and ordering principles are introduced when they become ambiguity sources; these may be deferred if not genuinely necessary for understanding individual features

## Planning Workflow

**Product**: Feature plan (`plan.md` in the work item's folder)

**Scope**: Produce a detailed descriptive document for a feature or work item. Define precise outcomes through research, invariants, edge cases, and scenarios. No implementation or code.

### Planning Aspects

These are not sequential phases — they are aspects of planning that apply throughout the process, revisited as understanding deepens.

**Assess** — review the work item, problem domain, stakeholder needs, known constraints, and current knowledge gaps. Assessment happens at the start and again whenever new information changes the picture.

**Research & Elaborate** — investigate technical feasibility, domain details, data flows, security/privacy needs, resource needs, risks, and non-functional requirements. Aggressively capture all findings directly into `plan.md`. Draft high-level invariants and goals. Refine descriptive outcomes (no code). This is intended as deep scrutiny to ensure the feature plan has sufficient detail to implement confidently and correctly. Avoid "double dipping" by documenting findings in the file rather than explaining them in chat.

**Open-and-verify** — a standing discipline within Research & Elaborate, checked again at Critically Assess: every concrete claim about existing code, content, or data traces to a file opened this session, and a remembered fact is a hypothesis until it does. Match the check to the claim: an absence claim (free of a string, a header, a dependency) is a search over the whole file; a compound condition cited as the reason a case is refused or reached is evaluated clause by clause, naming the ones that hold; a cited location (a file and line) is re-derived by a search that returns the line at the moment it is written, not from an earlier read. Claims about artifacts that do not yet exist are exempt. Survey claims carry `skills/evidence.md`'s confidence labels, and a fact or number inherited from another document, task, or measurement is a Hypothesis until confirmed for this task. Source: WIs 1210, 1705.

**Test (Descriptive)** — describe validation approaches: expected behaviors, failure modes, edge case scenarios, and thought experiments that confirm the plan is sound. No code or tests written — this is descriptive verification of the plan itself.

**Critically Assess** — check for gaps, ambiguity, contradictions, over- or under-scoping.
- Invariants are provably true, contain no unstated assumptions, and don't implicitly contradict other invariants
- Behaviors and verifications are sufficient to confirm correctness without guesswork
- **Open-and-verify** holds: every concrete claim traces to a file opened this session, and every cited location was re-derived when it was written

**Refine** — after any significant decisions, discoveries, or plan changes, apply another round of assessment and critical assessment to ensure the whole plan remains cohesive and consistent. Planning is not a single pass — it converges through iteration.

### Writing the Plan

Complete only sections genuinely needed for unambiguous implementation. Acceptance scenarios should focus on what constitutes sufficient completeness for human acceptance, rather than an exhaustive catalog of test cases.

This process is conducted closely with a human. If scrutiny reveals intractable ambiguity, the human should determine whether to revise scope, simplify descriptions, or defer the feature.

**After refinement complete (feature plan ready):**
- Record any major decisions or adjustments in the plan
- Proceed to implementation via the Code action

**Planning Mini-Retrospective**  
A brief, lightweight note on the planning process itself — not a full reflection (that happens after implementation via the Reflect action). List significant problems, research gaps, extra iterations, unplanned human interventions, or items warranting framework changes. A few bullet points is sufficient.

## Unplanned / Out-of-Scope Work

List explicitly in feature plans if relevant:
- Features/capabilities deliberately excluded
- Work outside current scope
- Desired features deferred to future work items

## Notes
- Human deeply involved in planning and review
- Planning documents must be unambiguous and detailed enough for correct first-pass implementation by AI
- Refine framework iteratively via phase mini-retrospectives
