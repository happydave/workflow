# Project

## Intent

Define a high-level goal or initiative that requires multiple work items to achieve. A project provides the context, vision, and architectural direction that individual work items must align with. It serves as an orchestration layer rather than a place for code changes.

## When to Create a Project

- A goal is too large or complex for a single work item
- An initiative involves changes across multiple repositories
- A "discovery" phase reveals a significant new feature area that needs structured decomposition
- Any time high-level design and architectural oversight are needed before breaking down work

Projects are "never finished" in the traditional sense; they exist as long as the initiative is active. They can be archived once all associated work items are completed and the goal is met.

## Document Storage & Naming

Projects are documented in a central location (e.g., a `tickets` repository), not within individual code repositories. Each project has a folder at `docs/projects/<slug>/` which holds the project record and prose artifacts:

- `design.md`: The architectural design for the project (see `Design.md`).
- `phases/`: One flat file per phase this project owns (see `Phase.md`).
- `runbooks/`: One file per operational procedure the project repeats — deploy to an environment,
  live test, rollback (see `Runbook.md`).
- `archive/`: A folder where completed work items associated with this project are moved.

## Required Content

Every project record must include:

- **Title** — a concise name for the project.
- **Status** — `active`, `inactive`, or `archived`. Starts as `active`.
- **Purpose** — the high-level "why" and "what" of the project.
- **Scope** — the boundaries of the project, including which repositories or systems are involved.

## Optional Content

- **Backlog** — a list of Work Item IDs associated with this project and their current status.
- **Phases** — the phases this project owns, each a record under `phases/` (see `Phase.md`), with their declared status. Membership is derived from the work items' own `phase` fields, never listed here as authority.
- **Runbooks** — the operations this project repeats, each a record under `runbooks/` (see
  `Runbook.md`), with its **Last executed** date. Work items that verify live run these rather than
  re-deriving the procedure.
- **Decisions** — dated, append-only decision entries. Settled decisions recorded in a project
  doc follow the Decision Records convention in `Design.md`: supersede by appending a new dated
  entry that names what it replaces and why — never by rewriting the stamped original.

## Procedure

1. **Initiate** — create `docs/projects/<slug>/project.md` with the Title, Purpose, Scope, and Status set to `active`.
2. **Discovery (Optional)** — if the project requires research before design, follow `Discover.md`.
3. **Design** — produce a high-level design following `Design.md`.
4. **Design Review** — subject the design to a formal review following `DesignReview.md`.
5. **Decomposition** — break the design down into individual Work Items following the WorkItem procedure, linking each back to the project. When the design has checkpoints or milestones whose work items must close together, create one phase per checkpoint following `Phase.md` and have each decomposed work item declare its phase.
6. **Execution** — manage the execution of work items.

## Status Tracking

- **active**: Project is being actively worked on.
- **inactive**: Project is paused or deprioritized.
- **archived**: All work items are finished and the project goal has been met.

Status updates are manual.
