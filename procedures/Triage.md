# Triage

## Intent

Convert unstructured input — intake files, playtest findings, a bug report
batch, a feature wishlist, a block of user feedback — into discrete,
prioritized work items, each with a root-cause hypothesis (for defects) or a
clear intent (for features), and with any human-decision points flagged
explicitly.

Triage is the promotion gate between intake (`Intake.md`) and the work-item
backlog: raw, un-atomized material goes in; accepted, atomized work items come
out. A work item in `docs/pending/` means triage (or an equivalent deliberate
decision) has already happened.

Triage is the connective tissue of the rapid-iteration loop (see
`RapidIteration.md`). The quality of everything downstream — planning, fixing,
sequencing — is inherited from the quality of triage. It is the highest-leverage
step when work arrives as a pile rather than a spec.

## When to Use

- To process the intake queue — one file from `docs/intake/` or many (see
  `Intake.md`).
- After a test/playtest produces a list of observations.
- When the requester hands over a batch of mixed feedback ("a few things…").
- Whenever incoming work is larger than one obvious change and not already broken
  into work items.

Do NOT use Triage for a single, already-scoped request — just do the work.

## Procedure

### 1. Secure the source material

If the input arrived live — a chat message, playtest notes, a verbal list —
write it to the intake inbox (`docs/intake/`, see `Intake.md`) before triaging,
even when triage proceeds immediately. The raw material is preserved regardless
of how triage slices it. Input already resting in `docs/intake/` needs nothing
here.

### 2. Itemize

Split the dump into atomic items. One symptom or one desired behavior per item.
Resist bundling unrelated things "because they were reported together."

### 3. Classify each item

- **Defect** (something is wrong) → hardening intent.
- **Design/feature** (something should exist or behave differently) → exploratory
  intent.
- **Confirmation / non-issue** → record in the disposition and drop (no work
  item).

### 4. Hypothesize and locate

For each defect, write a one-line **root-cause hypothesis** grounded in the code
(read enough to ground it; do not guess blindly). For each feature, write a
one-line **intent**. If a defect cannot be root-caused from reading, mark it
"needs repro/investigation" rather than inventing a fix.

### 5. Flag decision points

Mark every item that hides a choice only the requester can make (a behavior
trade-off, a mechanism with options, a scope call). These become explicit
questions, not silent assumptions. Decision points are surfaced before fixing,
not discovered mid-implementation.

### 6. Prioritize and group

- Severity first: asset loss / data loss / blocking bugs lead; cosmetic last.
- Group related items by **theme** (shared subsystem or shared root cause).
- Note complexity/scope. A big or tangled item gets its **own loop** rather than
  being squeezed into the batch (see nesting in `RapidIteration.md`).

### 7. Emit work items

Create a work item per item (or per tightly-coupled cluster), carrying the
hypothesis/intent, severity, and any flagged decisions. Record items deliberately
deferred or out of scope as work items too — do not lose them. An item that is a
future line of a project rather than a work item — a whole area still to design — goes
onto the project's roadmap (`Roadmap.md`) instead.

### 8. Disposition intake files

For each intake file consumed, append a disposition per item: the work item IDs
or project slugs it spawned, the roadmap line it was placed on (`Roadmap.md`), the
existing work item it merged into, or declined
with a one-line reason. A recorded disposition is never revised. When every item
in a file has a disposition, move the file to `docs/intake-processed/`. A
multi-item file with items still open stays in `docs/intake/`, its partial
dispositions recorded inline.

## Output

A prioritized, grouped set of work items with:
- root-cause hypothesis (defect) or intent (feature),
- severity/priority,
- flagged human-decision points,
- intent tag (hardening vs exploratory) to drive ceremony in the loop.

And every consumed intake file disposition-stamped and moved to
`docs/intake-processed/` (or held in `docs/intake/` with partial dispositions
while items remain open).

## Guidance

- Ground hypotheses in the code; an unrooted "fix" wastes a round.
- Separate "destroys/loses something" from "looks wrong" — they have different
  urgency and different fixes.
- Confirmations are signal too: record what is verified working so the loop can
  converge.
- Surface decision points up front; mid-fix discovery causes rework.
