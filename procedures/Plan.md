# Plan

## Purpose

Structured approach for deep human-AI collaboration on software projects. Human remains deeply involved throughout planning.

This document describes how to create feature plans for an AI agent, not a finished product other than those plans.

## Intent

Produce feature plans with enough clear, precise, descriptive detail that an AI can implement the feature correctly on the first attempt with minimal guesswork and maximum freedom for optimal implementation choices.

## Plan Structure

Every plan must include the sections below. Complete only what is genuinely necessary for unambiguous implementation; omit or mark optional sections that do not apply.

**Objective**
One clear sentence that captures the single desired purpose of the feature.
Example: Enable users to securely register, verify their email, and log in so they can access protected resources.

**Invariants & Hard Constraints**
Bullet list of non-negotiable truths that must always hold. Keep this list short and provable. Include only items that, if violated, break correctness, security, or compliance.

Each invariant must be traceable to an explicit statement or direct implication in the work item. Before adding an invariant, identify which sentence or requirement it derives from. Invariants with no traceable origin must not be added.

Good examples:
- Passwords are never stored in plain text or reversible form.
- All authentication tokens expire and cannot be used after revocation.
- Personally identifiable data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or stronger.

Bad example (do not add invariants like this):
- Must handle concurrent requests. *(Untraceable — the work item says nothing about concurrency; this is an invented constraint.)*

(For project-wide security rules — e.g., OWASP Top 10 mitigation, no plain-text secrets in logs — reference a central security.md or include critical ones here.)

**Required Behaviors & Verifications**
Concise descriptions of required behavior and verifiable success criteria. Organize by major concern (user-visible actions, data flows, security/privacy, etc.). Use SHALL statements for must-have outcomes and include focused scenarios (Gherkin-style or numbered steps) that define "done." Cover at least: one happy path, one key failure mode, one security-relevant case.

Tag each scenario by **verification mode** — the axis is *who can supply the verdict*:
- `[automated]` — a deterministic gate decides it: a test, a build, a lint, a schema check. Repeatable, pass/fail, no judgment.
- `[agent]` — no deterministic gate exists, but the agent can gather and judge the evidence itself by **inspecting the artifact**: reading a generated image or video frames, reading rendered output, diffing files, examining a produced document. Requires judgment, but the agent can supply it.
- `[human]` — requires the **owner**: aesthetic taste, a product or design call, physical hardware, hearing audio, playing the game, or a decision that is theirs to make. The agent cannot substitute for it.

The Code and Complete actions use these tags to know which outcomes the agent can close itself and which need the owner. **`[agent]` checks are the agent's responsibility to perform and close** — an unmet `[agent]` criterion is unfinished work, not a sign-off waiting on the owner, and must not be deferred as if it were. A work item whose only unmet criteria are `[human]` is implementation-complete pending that confirmation, not ambiguously unfinished.

Choosing `[human]` when `[agent]` would do is a real failure mode: it defers to the owner a check the agent could have run, and it lets a result that *looks* right on automated metrics pass without anyone inspecting the artifact. If you can look at the thing, tag it `[agent]` and look.

Certain feature shapes have repeatedly produced interleaving or coverage gaps that surfaced only at implementation. When the feature includes one of these, the plan must pin the detail explicitly:

- **An authentication default** — include one scenario per credential kind the system accepts (password, certificate, token, …), not just the default path.
- **A server-initiated message triggered by a client request** (a retained message on subscribe, a replay on connect) — state its order relative to the acknowledgement of the request that triggered it.
- **A replicated-state change** — say which node acts on apply and which acts on the proposer's result, and in what order those may interleave; defects live in the interleavings a plan does not name.
- **A shared identifier** (a key, a code, a name format used by more than one component) — state its exact form and which package owns it.
- **A gate command that includes a test-binary flag** — name the exact package path, not a `./...` pattern; other test binaries in the tree reject the flag.

**Migration note.** The prior two-way scheme used `[visual/manual]` for everything non-automated. An existing `[visual/manual]` tag should be read as `[human]` by default (the conservative reading); re-triage it to `[agent]` opportunistically when the check is in fact one the agent can perform by inspection.
Example:
- SHALL allow new users to register with a valid email and strong password, then send a time-limited verification link.
- SHALL reject registration attempts with duplicate emails (return 409 Conflict).
Given valid email and strong password
When user submits registration
Then verification email is sent and account is created in unverified state
AI has freedom over: route patterns, validation libraries, exact HTTP status wording (unless security-critical), internal error handling structure, and non-functional optimizations unless listed below.

**Edge Cases & Required Error Responses**
Bullet list of significant exceptions and exactly how the system must respond (status code, user message intent, retryability, etc.).

**Non-Functional Constraints** (only when critical to the project)
List only project-wide or feature-specific requirements that affect correctness or viability.

**Data & State Changes** (when the feature affects persistent state)
Simple description of new/updated entities and allowed transitions — no schema syntax or implementation detail.

**Explicit AI Freedom**
Mandatory closing section that lists what is intentionally **not** constrained. Tailor this list to reflect the actual project tech stack (e.g., specify allowed frameworks).
Example:
The AI has full discretion over:
- Choice of libraries and patterns within the approved tech stack
- File and directory organization
- Naming conventions (except where names are user-visible or constrained)
- Internal code structure and optimizations
- Exact phrasing of non-security-critical user messages

**Applicable Guidelines**
Identify which `skills/` documents apply to this project and record them in the plan. For each applicable guideline, note:
- What that guideline defines as the **build** step(s) — any procedure that compiles, formats, lints, or otherwise transforms source artifacts into verified output.
- What that guideline defines as the **test** step(s) — any procedure that validates correctness against specified behavior.

Reference these guidelines in the plan's **Required Behaviors & Verifications** section wherever build or test context is relevant. This information drives the Code and Document actions: implementers look here first rather than inferring guidelines from project structure.

Examples of applicable guidelines: `skills/go.md`, `skills/typescript.md`, `skills/docker.md`, `skills/markdown.md`, `skills/tooling.md`.

If no guidelines apply (e.g., a pure prose or workflow document), state that explicitly.

**Dependencies & Context**
Reference related documents or prior features only when order or shared invariants matter.

**Remaining Unknowns & Research Items**
Bullet list of items that require further research, testing, or human clarification. If an unknown is resolved, move the resulting requirements to the appropriate section; otherwise, keep it here to signal risk to the implementer.

## Style Guide

- Plaintext Markdown only
- Concise, objective, precise language
- No code (structs, functions, declarations) appears in any planning document
- Headings for structure (# Phase, ## Step)
- Bullets for lists; numbered for sequences
- Strong descriptive text of expected behavior, data flows, edge cases, invariants — enough to eliminate ambiguity for implementation
- Invariant section: each invariant provably true given fundamental constraints, with no unstated assumptions or dependencies and no implicit contradictions; traceability to the work item is governed by **Invariants & Hard Constraints** above
- This framework assumes invariants will be scrutinized during the Critically Assess step
- Heading hierarchy wording: avoid directional terms like "higher level" or "lower level" when describing markdown heading structure — these are ambiguous because H1 is simultaneously highest in document hierarchy and lowest in heading number. Use level-number comparisons instead: "a heading whose level number is ≤ N" or "a heading at depth ≤ the matched heading."

## Document Storage & Naming

Feature plans (prose artifacts) live inside the work item folder. When a work item is promoted to a plan, create `plan.md` in the folder:

- `docs/pending/<id>-<name>/plan.md`

The presence of `plan.md` in a work item folder indicates the item has been planned. The absence of `plan.md` indicates it has not.

## General Guidelines

### Language-Specific Guidelines

The planning process MUST identify all applicable guidelines and document them in the feature plan's **Applicable Guidelines** section. This is mandatory, not optional. Guidelines from `skills/[name].md` define the build and test procedures that Code and Document actions will use — they cannot be applied correctly if they are not named in the plan.

- Inspect the project root and purpose to determine which guidelines apply (e.g., `skills/go.md` for Go projects, `skills/typescript.md` (plus the applicable profile) for TypeScript projects, `skills/docker.md` for Docker-based builds, `skills/markdown.md` for documentation-heavy projects).
- `skills/tooling.md` applies whenever the work depends on an external tool (a CLI, MCP server, or editor extension), independently of language. Tool-specific reference material lives in `knowledge/tools/`.
- Record each applicable guideline and its defined build/test steps in the plan's Applicable Guidelines section.
- If a project spans multiple guidelines (e.g., Go + Docker), list all of them.

### Knowledge Management

- **File-First Documentation**: Aggressively add information to the plan doc as it is discovered. 
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not restate context or technical details in chat that are (or should be) in the `plan.md`. Use the plan as the primary storage for all technical findings.
- **State Management**: Use chat for coordination and intent; use the plan for specification. If you find yourself explaining "how" something works in chat, move that explanation to the plan instead.
- **Explicit Gaps**: Always maintain a "Remaining Unknowns" section to track items that require further research or human clarification before or during implementation.

### Cross-Feature Relationships

- Cross-feature dependencies and ordering principles are introduced when they become ambiguity sources; these may be deferred if not genuinely necessary for understanding individual features

### Measurements and Property Harnesses

When the work item includes a measurement (a benchmark, a scale run, a resource envelope), the plan requires:

- **Run it early.** The measurement runs once at a nominal scale as soon as it compiles, not at the end. A measurement that first executes on the final day discovers its harness bugs on the final day.
- **Assert starting conditions.** The measurement checks the preconditions it depends on (a settled machine, available ports, an empty data directory) and refuses to run when they do not hold, naming what it saw — rather than assuming them and producing a number that looks like a finding.

When the work item builds a harness that checks properties (invariants over runs, simulation checks), the plan additionally requires:

- **Violations carry evidence.** Each reported violation includes the state of the participants at the moment it happened, not only the fact of the violation. A one-line verdict forces a re-run with hand-added tracing for every diagnosis.
- **Exemptions expire.** An allowance carved out of a property names the work item that will remove it, and the suite reports how many times it fired. A silent exemption is load-bearing scope no one is tracking.
- **Properties state their non-vacuity.** For each property, say what makes it non-vacuous and assert that too (e.g., a run must actually deliver and acknowledge something). A property that passes over an idle system verifies nothing.
- **The harness's own client is tested.** The harness speaks a protocol; test its client against the same specification the product is judged by. When the harness reports a defect, the harness is one of the suspects.

## Planning Workflow

**Product**: Feature plan (`plan.md` in the work item's folder)

**Scope**: Produce a detailed descriptive document for a feature or work item. Define precise outcomes through research, invariants, edge cases, and scenarios. No implementation or code.

### Planning Aspects

These are not sequential phases — they are aspects of planning that apply throughout the process, revisited as understanding deepens.

**Assess** — review the work item, problem domain, stakeholder needs, known constraints, and current knowledge gaps. Assessment happens at the start and again whenever new information changes the picture.

**Research & Elaborate** — investigate technical feasibility, domain details, data flows, security/privacy needs, resource needs, risks, and non-functional requirements. Aggressively capture all findings directly into `plan.md`. Draft high-level invariants and goals. Refine descriptive outcomes (no code). This is intended as deep scrutiny to ensure the feature plan has sufficient detail to implement confidently and correctly. Avoid "double dipping" by documenting findings in the file rather than explaining them in chat.

**Open-and-verify** — a standing discipline within Research & Elaborate, checked again at Critically Assess: every concrete factual claim about existing code, content, or data must trace to a file opened during this planning session. This governs survey findings, required behaviors, and scenarios — if the plan asserts what a function returns, what a data file contains, which comment pins a value, or what a scenario will observe from shipped content, open that artifact and confirm the assertion before writing it down.

Recall and pattern-matching are a starting point, never the last step before a claim lands in the plan. A remembered fact is a hypothesis; an opened file is a finding. Match the verification to the claim's scope: when the plan asserts a file is *free of* something (a string, a licence header, a dependency), the check is a search over the whole file, not a read of its head — absence claims are only as good as the coverage of the look. When the plan cites a **location** — a file and line, or a line range — re-derive it with a search that returns the line (`grep -n`, a symbol lookup) at the moment it is written down. Having opened that file earlier in the session does not license a location written later: lines move under renames, edits and intervening reads, and a wrong line reads as a finding rather than as a guess, so the implementer follows it. Claims about artifacts that do not yet exist are exempt — nothing can be opened — so this rule binds assertions about what is already there, which is precisely where a confident-but-stale memory does its damage. Apply `skills/evidence.md` to survey claims: label them by confidence, and treat a number inherited from another document, task, or measurement as a Hypothesis until it is confirmed for *this* task (a result measured for one task does not automatically bound a different task that resembles it).

**Test (Descriptive)** — describe validation approaches: expected behaviors, failure modes, edge case scenarios, and thought experiments that confirm the plan is sound. No code or tests written — this is descriptive verification of the plan itself.

**Critically Assess** — check for gaps, ambiguity, contradictions, over- or under-scoping.
- Invariants are provably true, contain no unstated assumptions, and don't implicitly contradict other invariants
- Behaviors and verifications are sufficient to confirm correctness without guesswork
- Every concrete claim about existing code, content, or data was verified against an opened file this session, not written from recall, and every cited location was re-derived by a search when it was written rather than remembered from an earlier read (see **Open-and-verify** above)

**Refine** — after any significant decisions, discoveries, or plan changes, apply another round of assessment and critical assessment to ensure the whole plan remains cohesive and consistent. Planning is not a single pass — it converges through iteration.

### Writing the Plan

Complete only sections genuinely needed for unambiguous implementation. Acceptance scenarios should focus on what constitutes sufficient completeness for human acceptance, rather than an exhaustive catalog of test cases.

This process is conducted closely with a human. If scrutiny reveals intractable ambiguity, the human should determine whether to revise scope, simplify descriptions, or defer the feature.

**After refinement complete (feature plan ready):**
- Record any major decisions or adjustments in the plan
- Proceed to implementation via the Code action

**Planning Mini-Retrospective**  
A brief, lightweight note on the planning process itself — not a full reflection (that happens after implementation via the Reflect action). List significant problems, research gaps, extra iterations, unplanned human interventions, or items warranting framework changes. A few bullet points is sufficient.

## Unplanned / Out-of-Scope Work

List explicitly in feature plans if relevant:
- Features/capabilities deliberately excluded
- Work outside current scope
- Desired features deferred to future work items

## Notes
- Human deeply involved in planning and review
- Planning documents must be unambiguous and detailed enough for correct first-pass implementation by AI
- Refine framework iteratively via phase mini-retrospectives
