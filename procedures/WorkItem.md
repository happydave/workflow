# Work Item

## Intent

Capture a potential work item — a feature idea, bug report, improvement, or observation — as a lightweight record in a centralized `docs/pending/` directory. Work items are intake documents, not plans. They preserve enough context for later triage and planning without requiring deep analysis at the time of creation.

Work items may originate from any source: an external issue tracker, a conversation, a problem encountered during implementation, or an idea that surfaces opportunistically during unrelated work. The goal is to capture it before the context is lost.

## When to Create a Work Item

- A feature idea or enhancement is identified
- A bug or unexpected behavior is discovered during testing or usage
- An external request or issue needs to be tracked
- A project design is being decomposed into actionable steps
- Any time the thought "we should do X" arises and X is not already tracked

Do not defer capture. A brief work item written now is more valuable than a detailed one never written.

## Document Storage & Naming

Work items are stored in a central management repository (e.g., `tickets`), not in individual code repositories. Each work item has a folder at `docs/pending/<id>-<name>/`. The ID is assigned by reading `docs/pending/next` and incrementing it before creating any files — see the Procedure section for the full sequence. The folder is the home for all artifacts related to that work item. As work progresses through planning and implementation, additional files are added to the same folder (see Plan and Code procedures). When work is complete, the entire folder moves to `docs/archive/` following the Archive procedure.

## Required Content

Every work item record must include:

- **Title** — a concise description of the work item.
- **Status** — the current state of the work item (e.g., `pending`, `complete`).
- **Project** — the slug of the project this work item belongs to, or `none` for standalone items.
- **Description** — enough context to understand the need without referring to the original source. One to three sentences is often sufficient. Include the "why" — what problem this solves or what capability it enables.

## Optional Content

Include these when they are known and useful. Omit them when they are not:

- **Proposed Changes** — a brief sketch of what might be built. This is a starting point for planning, not a commitment.
- **Acceptance Criteria** — conditions that would confirm the work is done. Keep these outcome-oriented, not implementation-specific.
- **Target Project** — which project will contain the implementation work; defaults to the capturing project when omitted or empty. Supports multiple targets via comma-separated listing, though one work item per project is recommended for clarity. This field can be safely omitted when the work item originates inside the target project.
- **Source** — where the work item originated (external issue URL, implementation log reference, conversation summary) if it helps preserve context.
- **Reference Docs** - API documentation or similar if available.

## Procedure

1. **Assign an ID** — read `docs/pending/next` to obtain the next available ID `N`. Write `N + 1` back to `docs/pending/next` before creating any files. If `docs/pending/next` does not exist, determine `N` by finding the highest-numbered existing folder in `docs/pending/` and adding one, then write `N + 1` to `docs/pending/next` before proceeding.
2. **Capture** — create `docs/pending/<N>-<name>/workitem.md` with at minimum the Title and Description. Err on the side of writing it down quickly rather than crafting it perfectly.
3. **Contextualize** — if immediately obvious, add proposed changes and acceptance criteria. If not, leave them out — they belong in the planning phase, not the work item. **Do not invent acceptance criteria that were not stated or are not directly implied by the description.** Criteria not grounded in the description add scope without adding value and distort planning later.

## Guidance

- Work items are not plans. They do not need to meet the standard of a feature plan document. They exist to prevent ideas and problems from falling through the cracks.
- Keep work items short. A work item that takes more than five minutes to write is probably trying to be a plan.
- Do not duplicate external issue trackers verbatim. Summarize the relevant context in the project's own terms.
- Acceptance criteria in work items are intentionally lighter than in feature plans. They answer "how would we know this is done?" not "what are all the edge cases?"
- When Status is `complete`, no further active development is expected for this work item.
